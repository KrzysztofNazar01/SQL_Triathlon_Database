During the course, the student has three tasks - all of them are based on the same topic selected at the beginning of the project activities.
The report of the project consists of 3 major parts:
 1. Assumptions
 2. ERD with description
 3. Sample SELECT queries

## Assumptions

Polish Triathlon Association

### Client's goal and requirements
